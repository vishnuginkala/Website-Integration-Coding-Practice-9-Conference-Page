In this assignment, let's build a Conference Page by applying the concepts we learned till now. You can use the Bootstrap concepts and CCBP UI Kit as well.

Refer to the below images.
Conference Home Page:

conference-page-to-build
Conference Details Page:

conference-page-to-build
Note
When clicked on the Know more button on the Conference Home Page, it must display the Conference Details Page.
Try to achieve the design as close as possible.
Important Note
Warning
The CCBP UI kit works only if the value of the HTML id attribute of the container section has the prefix as section. So, the id which we specify for any section should always contain its prefix as section if you are using CCBP UI Kit.

Sections must be parallel and not nested within each other.

HTML
<div id="sectionHomePage">...</div>
<div id="sectionConferencePage">...</div>

Avoid assigning Bootstrap flex properties directly to a section container.

Example
Wrong usage:
HTML
<div id="sectionHomepage" class="d-flex">
  ...
</div>
